Elementary is a JavaScript framework for writing functional, declarative audio applications with a high
performance, native audio engine. Elementary aims to lower the barrier to entry into the
audio application space, eliminate the gap between prototyping and production, and bring the functional reactive
programming model to DSP.

Watch the [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvCdrflFHu8) for the full story.

## Installation

To run these examples you'll need to install both the `npm` dependencies, as shown below, and the Elementary

## Examples

Here in the `examples/` directory you'll find a small set of example projects aiming to provide a brief introduction to various functionality. Each
example can be invoked on its own:
