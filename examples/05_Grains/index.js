// This example shows another approach to sample playback and manipulation.
//
// Here, instead of using `el.sample` for sample playback, we'll use `el.table`,
// which acts much like a lookup table: we load our sample into a buffer, and
// can read from that buffer with a normalized lookup position between [0, 1].
//
// To make things interesting, this example runs two phasors in parallel, each
// reading tiny slices of the sample bufferâ€“ a very basic granulator. To smooth
// things out, we apply a hann window to each grain, and offset the phasors to
// create a continuous soundbed.
//
// For interesting results, try updating the SAMPLE_PATH here to a longer file,
// maybe several seconds long or more, to hear the grain readers slowly sweeping
// across the file.

  let t = el.phasor(1);
  let t2 = el.sub(el.add(t, 0.5), el.floor(el.add(t, 0.5)));

  // Next we derive our "reader" signals, `r` and `r2`, by swinging a slow sine
  // shaped LFO within [0, 1] and summing our phasors into it, multiplying each
  // phasor by 0.01 to ensure that it only sweeps through a tiny portion of the buffer (a grain).

  // Then here we put it together: a lowpass filter with cutoff modulation running
  // over the sum of the two grain readers: each grain reader is a hann window multiplied
  // by the result of the `el.table` read.
